BuildingControlLib
==================

Welcome to BuildingControlLib, a Modelica library for modelling and simulation of standardized and non-standardized control functions from Building Automation Systems. The library is developed at maintained at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics IBP](https://www.ibp.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in the [Technical Building Systems Working Group](https://www.ibp.fraunhofer.de/en/Expertise/energy-efficiency-and-indoor-climate/TechnicalBuildingSystemsSolutions.html) in Nuremberg, Germany.
